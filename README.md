# Hello ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

I am class 10th student and I love programming. 
I have learned python, reactjs, javascript, css, tailwind, bootstrap, php.
I am very slow in post projects on github because I don't have any laptop or desktop, So I code on mobile phone with the help of Acode(code editor) and termux.
I mostly love web development but I can desktop too.
